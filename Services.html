             <h3> Pump-Installation</h3>

             <p> If you own a pool, then the pool pump is probably the largest electric motor in your home. <br>
                 It also consumes up to a few thousand kilo-watt hours per year, making it second only to to your <br>
                 air conditioner or heat pump.  Your pool pump could be your home's second largest energy user, costing <br>
                 you as much as $270 in utility bills every year.  You can save energy and maintain a comfortable swimming pool<br>
                  temperature by using a smaller, higher efficiency pump and by operating it less.  Also, using an ENERGY STAR <br>
                  certified pool pump can save more than $300 over the lifetime of the pump.  </p>

              <span>  <h3> MEP Installation</h3>   </span>
            <p> Pool MEP work is an abbreviation for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing engineering. All these three major technical<br>
                 fields cover the system that makes the buildings habitable for humans. These three technical fields are designed together <br>
                 because of their high degree of interaction. The combination of these three is very important for construction, as when these <br>
                  three systems – mechanical, electrical, and plumbing, are designed in isolation, they could create clashes. However, their <br>
                  combined approach prevents equipment location conflicts.

                <h3> SPA</h3>
                <p> If you are new to the world of swim spas, you may wonder – is it like a traditional swimming pool? <br>
                    Unlike traditional pools which take up a significant amount of space and cost a substantial amount<br>
                     of money for only limited usage, swim spas are compact options for incredible swimming, relaxation, <br>
                     and fitness activities with no “off season.”</p>

            <h3> Music Fountain</h3>
                 <p> A musical fountain, also known as a fairy fountain, prismatic fountain or dancing fountain,<br>
                     is a type of choreographed fountain that creates aesthetic designs as a form of entertainment.<br>
                      The displays are commonly synchronised to music and also feature lighting effects that are refracted<br>
                       and reflected by the moving water. Contemporary multimedia fountains can include lasers, video projection<br>
                        and three-dimensional imagery.</p>
